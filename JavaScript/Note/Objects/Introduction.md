# Object
- data structure in JavaScript
- important for grouping data and functionalities
- objects are variables too.
- values are written as **name: value** pairs _(name and value separated by a colon)_
- It is a common practice to declare objects with the ```const``` keyword.
- may consist of several variables and functions _(which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects)_.

**Defining object:**
```
const person = {
    name: "abc",
    age: 15,
    isStudent: true
};
```
**Access the object's properties:**
- use ```.``` notation
```
person.name;    //to access name
```
