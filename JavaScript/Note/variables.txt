There are 2 types of variable in js that are declared by const and let/var

We use let instead of var to declare a changing variable because var creates alot of problems in the future.

eg:
const pi = 22/7
let length = 21

-To assign a value to the variable we use =

But to compare the variables we use == and to check its type as well we use ===
